    body: 'It centers around a Hollywood stuntman and a little girl, both in the same hospital, and the man tells the girl a fantastical story in exchange for something I won\'t spoil here. The story is great, but the cinematography is out of this world. Main character is Lee Pace, the bad guy from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1 and the good guy in Pushing Daisies.'},

    body: 'So I put myself in debt today (38k) buying a nice 2021 Toyota Supra 3.0 Premium in Nitro Yellow. I\'ve driven sub-160 horsepower 4cyl econoboxes all my life and after hard work saving up a sizeable down payment for a "bargain or entry level" Sports car but I\'ve discovered a certain side effect...... the attention.\n' +

      'I took it out for a 60 mile spin right off the dealer and legit every time I stopped at a stop light people to my sides would roll down their windows and try and chat me up and give thumbs up ect which I return with a genuine smile on my face saying thanks. I do somewhat enjoy these interactions.... well as much as a reserved introverted type person can XD. Unfortunately not all of them are nice, had a junker van full of what looked like homeless drug addicts verbally accost me as I just sat there waiting for the light to turn green + all the Dodge Chargers pulling around me and trying to race ect. (mind you this all happened on the first drive off the lot)\n' +

      'I just did not expect attention from a sub-60k sports car especially since its Toyota. Anyone else have any stories and experiences they would like to share?'},
